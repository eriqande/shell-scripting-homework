Please submit code answers in the fenced `sh` code blocks below
each question/request below.  Note that these code blocks are not
intended to be evaluated in the Notebook.  Just include the code that
you wrote to solve each problem, by copying it into the block, but
evaluate the code in Terminal, or in the RStudio Git Bash terminal.
**Do Not** print the resulting output unless asked to, as
some of the outputs might be quite a lot of text.

But, do preview the notebook when you are done, and commit the updated nb.html file.

# `cd` from your home directory to the repository directory

```sh
cd to wherever the repo is
```

# Recursively list all the contents of the `data_dump` directory

```sh
ls -R data_dump
```
Yowzers that is a lot of files.  This is the directory structure
that Matt's Rosy Finch data came in.  These files are not actually
fastq files.  Each one just has the SHA1 hash of the file name.



# That Didn't give us quite what we wanted.  We want the full paths for each file.  Get that with the following:
```sh
find data_dump | awk '/\.fq$/'
```

# Holy Cow! How many files is that? Count them.  Show the code and the result
```sh
find data_dump | awk '/\.fq$/' | wc 
```

896     896   83680

# Assign all those filenames into a variable called FQFILES. Use command substitution with `$( )`.
```sh
FQFILES=$(find data_dump | awk '/\.fq$/')
```

# Cycle over the names in FQFILES (using `for`) and print just the directory name part of their names
```sh
for i in $FQFILES; do dirname $i; done 
```

# What are the names of the distinct directories these files are in, and how many are there?  Figure this out by piping the result from the above command into the `uniq` command.  Show the output of this one (should be only 3 lines)
```sh
% for i in $FQFILES; do dirname $i; done | uniq

data_dump/ROFI1/C202SC19050157/raw_data
data_dump/ROFI2/H202SC19091397/raw_data
data_dump/ROFI3/H202SC19100113/raw_data

```

# Make a directory called `all_fastqs` at the top level of the directory
```sh
mkdir all_fastqs
```


# Cycle over the FQFILES (using `for`) and for each one print, on the same line, the full path of the file, followed by a space and then just the basename of the file. Use `echo` and command substitution with `$( )`.
```sh
for i in $FQFILES; do echo $i $(basename $i); done 
```

# Do the same as the previous exercise, but add (in front of the basename of each file) the word `all_fastqs/` so that they all look like paths.  Below is an example of what the first few lines of output should look like:
```
data_dump/ROFI1/C202SC19050157/raw_data/s17N04030_USPD16103200-N709-AK394_H3LJCCCX2_L5_1.fq all_fastqs/s17N04030_USPD16103200-N709-AK394_H3LJCCCX2_L5_1.fq
data_dump/ROFI1/C202SC19050157/raw_data/s17N04030_USPD16103200-N709-AK394_H3LJCCCX2_L5_2.fq all_fastqs/s17N04030_USPD16103200-N709-AK394_H3LJCCCX2_L5_2.fq
data_dump/ROFI1/C202SC19050157/raw_data/s17N04030_USPD16103200-N709-AK394_H3LJCCCX2_L6_1.fq all_fastqs/s17N04030_USPD16103200-N709-AK394_H3LJCCCX2_L6_1.fq
```
Put your code here:
```sh
for i in $FQFILES; do echo $i all_fastqs/$(basename $i); done 
```


# Using the code from the previous exercise, but changing `echo` to `cp`, copy each file to within the `all_fastqs` directory. 
```sh
for i in $FQFILES; do cp $i all_fastqs/$(basename $i); done 
```
By the end of this, you should have 896 files in that `all_fastqs` directory.


# Now, define a new variable called FASTQS that holds the paths of all the `.fq` files in the directory `all_fastqs`. Do it just with path expansion
```sh
FASTQS=all_fastqs/*.fq
```


# Hard problem:

There is a script in `scripts` called `random-fail.sh`.  It prints the number of digits in the first column of the first row of a file. I want you to cycle over the files in `all_fastqs`, redirecting _stderr_ to _append_ to a single file called `error-messages.txt` (this file should be removed before you start cycling over the FASTQS) and also redirecting standard output from `random-fail.sh` into a file that has the same name as the one from `all_fastqs1` but with `.gz` replaced by `.counts`. That is when you run the script like:
```sh
./scripts/random-fail.sh all_fastqs/s18N03747_USPD16103199-N704-AK400_H3LJCCCX2_L4_2.fq
```
I want the output to go into a file called:
```sh
all_fastqs/s18N03747_USPD16103199-N704-AK400_H3LJCCCX2_L4_2.counts
```
After that, cat the contents of the `.counts` file,
_but only if the_ `random-fail.sh` _script did not fail on that particular file_.  (`random_fail.sh` fails some fraction of the time, randomly, and when it does it returns a non-zero exit status).  

So, at the end, you should have a lot of files like:
```
all_fastqs/s18N03747_USPD16103199-N704-AK400_H3LJCCCX2_L4_2.counts
```
and you should have a file, `error-messages.txt`, that contains all the
messages written to _stderr_ each time `random-fail.sh` failed. Also,
you should never have tried to `cat` a `.counts` file that did not exist.

```sh
rm -f error-messages.txt
for i in $FASTQS; do
  ./scripts/random-fail.sh $i 2>> error-messages.txt > ${i/.fq/.counts} && \
  cat ${i/.fq/.counts}
done
```

# When you are done with that, print the lines in error-messages.txt
```sh

```
